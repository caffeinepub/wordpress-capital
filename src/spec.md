# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive one-page marketing website for “WordPress Capital” with smooth in-page navigation, a hero section, and a clearly presented services list.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement a single-page layout with multiple sections and smooth anchor-link navigation in the top header.
- Add a Hero section featuring “WordPress Capital”, an English tagline aligned to the listed services, and a CTA button that scrolls to the Services section.
- Add a Services section listing exactly: WordPress Development (with bullet points for “Theme creation/customisation” and “Plugin development”), WooCommerce Development, Shopify Development, ReactJS / Vue JS, and Hosting solutions.
- Apply a cohesive creative visual theme (colors/typography/spacing/components) that avoids a blue/purple primary palette.
- Add and render static generated image assets (logo in header; hero visual in hero) from `frontend/public/assets/generated` without distortion or layout shift.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a polished, mobile-friendly one-page “WordPress Capital” site, navigate smoothly between sections, and see the business branding and services at a glance.
