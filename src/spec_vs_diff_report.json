  "summary": "Diff adds a one-page React/Tailwind frontend with sticky header navigation and a services list, plus styling/theme tokens. However, it does not show the required generated image assets being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and one service label capitalization differs from the spec. It also introduces Internet Identity/auth + React Query actor plumbing that was not requested for this static one-page site.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the generated image assets as static files under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (logo and hero illustration) and render them in the page.",
      "reason": "The frontend references `/assets/generated/wp-capital-logo.dim_512x512.png`, but the diff does not include any added files under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (no images shown in added files list), so the required assets are not evidenced as present.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Services must include all provided offerings with correct spelling/capitalization, including \"Hosting solutions\".",
